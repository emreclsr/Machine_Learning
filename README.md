# Machine Learning

This script are about machine learning.

Three different learning algorithms are used:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

In here four different datasets are used:
- [Hitters Baseball Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/hitters-baseball-data)
- [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- FLO (Private)

This project is a part of the [Turkcell Data Science Bootcamp](https://gelecegiyazanlar.turkcell.com.tr/gelecegi-yazanlar).
